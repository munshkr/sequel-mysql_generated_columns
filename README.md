# sequel-mysql_generated_columns

Sequel extension that ads support for MySQL generated columns (added first on MySQL 5.7.5).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sequel-mysql_generated_columns'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sequel-mysql_generated_columns


## Usage

To enable extension, call `DB.extension :mysql_generated_columns`.

*TODO: Write usage examples*


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
